# _Assignment_
## Provided with an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files:
Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. Your task is to perform
exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and derive actionable insights. This
assignment will test your data analysis, machine learning, and business insight generation skills.
Customers.csv:

Products.csv :

Transactions.csv :

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset.
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA.
○ Write these insights in short point-wise sentences (maximum 100 words per
insight).
## Task 2: Lookalike Model
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar
customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:
● Use both customer and product information.
● Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.
## Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information
(from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv).
● You have the flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters in
between(2 and 10)
● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this).
● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots.
