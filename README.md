# _Assignment_
## Provided with an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files:
Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. The task is to perform
exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and derive actionable insights. 

* Customers.csv: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bu_--mo79VdUG9oin4ybfFGRUSXAe-WE/view?usp=sharing
* Products.csv : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKuDizVapw-hyktwfpoAoaGtHtTNHfd0/view?usp=sharing
* Transactions.csv : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1saEqdbBB-vuk2hxoAf4TzDEsykdKlzbF/view?usp=sharing

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset.
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA.
3. Write these insights in short point-wise sentences

## Task 2: Lookalike Model
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar
customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:
● Use both customer and product information.
● Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.

## Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information
(from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv).
● We are choosing Kmeans clustering algorithm and  number of clusters as 4
● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this).
● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots.
